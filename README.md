# Welcome
## Why do we need this python module?
**This library will make you not confused in python. for examle if you want to print only part of string,**
## Installation
`pip install noConfusion`

## Example
`str = '"hello world'`
<br>
`print(str[firstindex:lastindex])`
<br>
the meaning of the confusion in this code is that you sometimes don't 
remember if the first index is included or not or last index is excluded or not.</p>
